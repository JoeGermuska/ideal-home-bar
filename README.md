# The Ideal Home Bar

##### What is this?
A work in progress blueprint for the ideal bar setup. Hopefully with multiple flavors, like minimal, normal, huge, etc.

##### Why did you pick _____?
Probably because there's a staple drink with it that I love. I am probably wrong though, and since this is about curating the best bar possible, I look forward to many  suggestions/pull requests/forks!

##### What do I do with it?
Fork and/or pull request. I'd love to see what the rest of you are drinking.

Or, alternatively: go buy these things and enjoy some cocktails!
